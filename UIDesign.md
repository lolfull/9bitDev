# UI DESIGN PAGE
[Home](README.md)   

### Home/Dashboard
The dashboard is the home page of our app, where an overview of the user’s data can be seen. In the centre of this screen is be a pie chart of the user’s spending, with different colours corresponding to different categories. Three buttons, labeled “daily”, “weekly”, and “monthly”, are directly below the pie chart and can be pressed to view the average spending for the selected period. Beside the chart are the specific data points for each category.    

Additionally, new transactions can be entered in a field under the pie chart, and budgeting tips are displayed in the corner of the screen.   

- overview of all budgeting, pie chart of spending (daily/weekly/monthly)
- information for pie chart next to it
- user input updates shown under pie chart
- budgeting tips in the corner

### Budget
The budget screen is where the user can set and change their monthly income. The user can also input their expenses and other transactions in order to receive budgeting tips and track spending which will be displayed on the dashboard. To facilitate this tracking, bar graphs of the top spending categories will aid the user in understanding their spending habits (also in dashboard).    

- summary of top spending categories
- input for new transaction
- ability to change savings goal and monthly income
- after inputting transaction/making changes to settings, dashboard will update based on changed info 

### Rewards/Achievements
The game page keeps track of the user's achievements and rewards. For instance, as a reward for sticking to a budget limit for a week, an achievement may fill up as the week progresses, and finally unlock when the week is over. Rewards include in-app rewards, where the user can unlock costumes or other items relating to a personal avatar, and external rewards, where the user can receive gift card vouchers. However, rewards are planned as an additional feature that will only be implemented if time permits.    

- Budget comparison with other people? friends? your past budgets?
- rewards system
- achievements or encouragement messages
- budget comparison

## MOCKUPS

Navigation done through sidebar.
